## Instructions for playing
When you launch the game, three different buttons will appear on the screen.
Tap on the one corresponding to the difficulty level you want to play with.
The screen will show you a set of 9 Dots randomly generated on a colored background that you need to reproduce by mixing them.
If you don’t like the proposed set of colors or you want to make a new game, go back and tap the reset button at the bottom right.
In order to mix two colors, drag and drop one Dot on another.
Since some level can be challenging, you can find help by tapping the ‘?’ at the top right: that will show a quick overview of the relationships between the fundamental colors.
Moreover, if you are still on the right track to get the solution, after 10 seconds of inactivity the game provides a suggestion highlighting two Dots.
You win the game when the mix you do produces the background color.

## Technical requirements
The game was made in Swift Playground using Xcode 9.2
